FUNCTIONS
    cleanup_and_exit(drive, msg=None)
        Function clearing the encryption parameters from the drive. Exits the program with code -1
        after completion.
        :param drive: The drive whose encryption parameters are to be cleared.
        :param msg: Array of strings to be printed on exit.
    
    disable_encryption(drive, backend_path='../bin/spout_cmd')
        Disable the encryption and clear all encryption parameters from the drive.
        Calls C++ backend in order to communicate with the drive via the SCSI interface.
        :param drive: The drive whose encryption parameters are to be cleared.
        :param backend_path: String of the path where the backend binary is located.
        :return: The backend's process return code.
        In case the SCSI backend binary cannot be read, it will return the error message as a string.
    
    enable_encryption(key, drive, backend_path='../bin/spout_cmd')
        Enable the encryption and pass encryption parameters to the drive.
        Calls C++ backend in order to communicate with the drive via the SCSI interface.
        :param key: The key with which the drive will be encrypting/decrypting data.
        :param drive: The drive whose encryption parameters are to be cleared.
        :param backend_path: String of the path where the backend binary is located.
        :return: The backend's process return code if there is a key, None otherwise.
        In case the SCSI backend binary cannot be read, it will return the error message as a string.
    
    extract_key_id_from_tag(vid)
        Function extracting the key_id from the tag of the given VID from the VMGR database.
        :param vid: The VID of the tape whose tag is to be returned.
        :return: The key_id that is stored in the tag column of the VMGR database if command !=0.
        Otherwise the return value of the command.
    
    extract_pool_name(vid)
        Extract the pool name based the vid of the tape.
        It's results are based on the output of `vmgrlisttape` tool.
        :param vid: The VID of the tape whose pool we are searching for.
        :return: The pool name of the given VID or the return code of the `vmgrlisttape`
        command if != 0. Otherwise the return value of the command.
    
    get_json_hash(filename='/etc/castor/encryption/tape-encryption-keys.json')
        Load JSON hash into memory.
        :param filename: The filename of the json file in the disk.
        :return: The JSON hash loaded, else a tuple of an empty None and the error message.
    
    update_key_id_to_tag(key_id, vid)
        Function updating the key_id to the tag of a specific vid to the VMGR database .
        :param key_id: The key_id whose value will be copied to the tag field.
        :param vid: The VID of the tape whose tag will be updated.
        :return: The key_id read from the tag or the return code of the `vmgr` command if failed.

DATA
    BACKEND_BINARY_PATH = '../bin/spout_cmd'
    JSON_FILENAME = '/etc/castor/encryption/tape-encryption-keys.json'
